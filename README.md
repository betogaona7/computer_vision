Exercises related to computer vision

- _**YOLO**_ - Implementation of the state-of-art real time object detection algorithm You Only Look Once using a pretrained model. 
- _**Attention**_ - An implementation of _attention_ in isolation from a larger model. Paper: [Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025).
- _**Optical-Flow**_ - Implementation of optical flow algorithm, it tracks objects by looking at where the same points have moved from one image frame to the next. 
- _**CNN-Layer-Visualizer**_ - Program to visualize the output of a convolutional layer, an activated convolutional layer, or a pooling layer.
- _**ORB**_: Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief algorithm implementation using OpenCV to perfom object detection.
- _**HOG**_: Histogram of Oriented Gradients algorithm explained and implemented using OpenCV 
- _**K-means**_: Perfomed image segmentation using K-means clustering.
- _**Clothing-classifier**_: Clothing classifier using FashionMNIST dataset, ```90%``` accuracy, model from scratch.
- _**Face-detection**_: Face detection using OpenCV, especifically performed using a haarcascade detector. 
- _**Circle-detection**_: A dectection program using The Hough Transform to detect consistent shapes, in this case circles.
- _**Contour-detection**_: Perfomed image segmentation by detecting contours.
- _**Corner-detection**_: Detect corners (interection of two edges where gradient is high on all directions) using Harris Corner Detector.
- _**Day-or-night**_: A day and night image classifier that uses the average brightness of an image as a threshold to perform the classification.
